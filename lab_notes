login.c 	new file
defs.h		defs for login.c
syscall.h	SYS_swtchusr


plan:
1. implement addusr (needs current user to be root)
	* keep nextUid in file /nextUid
2. add uid field to proc
3. give file ownership to user
	* add uid field to inode and dinode (possibly others??)
4. for all file manipulation commands (open, close, read) implement user verification
	* in ialloc: if type == file, then also set dip's uid field to proc's uid field
	* readi: if ip->uid != proc->uid, then panic
	* writei: if ip->uid != proc->uid, then panic
